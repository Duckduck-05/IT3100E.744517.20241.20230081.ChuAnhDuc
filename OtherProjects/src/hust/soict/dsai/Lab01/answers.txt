Questrions:
1.	What happens if users choose “Cancel”?
2.	How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t” (Suggestion: Use Javadocs or using Eclipse/Netbean IDE help). 

Answers:
1. There will be a MessageDiaglog pop up and say "You've chosen No"
2. We will need to add optionType for the showConfirmDialog method. Particularly:
Change "int option = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,
				"Do you want to change to the first class ticket?");"
Into "int option = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null,
				"Do you want to change to the first class ticket?","",JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION);"
