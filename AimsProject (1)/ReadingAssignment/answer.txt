Question: Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 

==> Java is strictly pass-by-value. However, the way it handles object references can make it seem like pass-by-reference in certain cases.
(For object references, it passes the value of the reference, leading to behaviors that resemble pass-by-reference)
